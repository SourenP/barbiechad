## Description
Four is a web app that generates a playlist from a time-series of values based on a metric. A user chooses points on a graph where the x-axis is time (the length of the playlist) and the y-axis is the value of a metric. They can also specify a genre if they would like to limit the results. After a user submits their points, a playlist is generated that that follows the curve of their points in order to create a stream of songs that transitions smoothly from one level to the next.

Metric examples:
* Tempo
* Pitch
* Loudness
* Energy
* Danceability

### Class of users
This app would be useful for people who want a playlist that transitions smoothly between the given metrics, such as energy or tempo. This applies to groups like DJ’s, who would want smooth changes in their sets, or people who work out, who wants a smooth change of pace in their workout playlist.
